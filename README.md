This machine learning system is able to classify traffic signs.
No special libraries are required, outside the standard TF, Keras, Sci-kit Learn, Numpy libraries.
For training, use Model_Train.ipynb. Model_Train.ipynb trains a CNN and prints its training history (100 epochs of train/valid loss and accuracy),
its predictions on the training data, and an accuracy score.
Model_Test.ipynb tests the group's model (CNN_overlap.h5) on your data and returns its predictions and an accuracy score
The model to be used for testing is CNN_overlap.h5. It is uploaded in the Model_Test notebook.
